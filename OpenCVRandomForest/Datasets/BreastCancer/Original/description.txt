1) ID number

2) Outcome (R = recur, N = nonrecur)

3) Time (recurrence time if field 2 = R, disease-free time if 
	field 2	= N)


4-33) Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:

a) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)

b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)

c) perimeter

d) area

e) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)

f) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)

g) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)

h) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)

i) symmetry
j) fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)
